# 🧑‍💻 AI-Native Projects Portfolio  

## ⚠️ Note on Code Access  
Due to organization restrictions, I cannot share private source code from TYNYBAY projects.  
Instead, I’m sharing **live demos with credentials** and detailed usage instructions.  
These projects demonstrate my ability to design, build, and ship **AI-native applications** end-to-end.

## 1. 🎬 Video Gen (AI-powered faceless video generation)  
**Demo Link:** [Video Gen](https://video-gen-fbcu9.ondigitalocean.app/)  
**Credentials:**  
- username: `john_doe`  
- password: `Password$123$`  

**How to Use:**  
1. Log in  
2. Enter any prompt to generate a faceless video  
3. Track status in the bottom panel  
4. Once complete, download and view the generated video  

**Tech Highlights:**  
- AI-powered text-to-video generation  
- Async job tracking + status updates  
- Downloadable media pipeline

## 2. 📊 Chat + Analytics (AI-driven CRM-style analytics assistant)  
**Demo Link:** [Chat + Analytics](https://quess-corp-fe-7ao56.ondigitalocean.app/)  
**Credentials:**  
- username: `john_doe`  
- password: `Password$123$`  

**How to Use:**  
- Use sidebar to query (e.g., *“Show me revenue for last five years”*)  
- Retrieves data from Quess Corp’s 2023–24 annual reports  
- Ask *“Generate chart”* to visualize results  
- Features persistent **chat history** + previous charts  

**Tech Highlights:**  
- RAG pipeline over structured annual reports  
- Dynamic chart generation  
- Chat history persistence + context recall

## 3. 🎤 Voice AI + Analytics Agent (multi-agent orchestration)  
**Demo Link:** [Voice AI + Analytics](https://oclus-v3-frontend-686or.ondigitalocean.app/)  
**Credentials:**  
- username: `john_doe`  
- password: `Password$123$`  

**How to Use:**  
1. Log in → click **Start Call**  
2. Ask: *“What is the EBITDA value in Quess Corp’s 2024 annual report?”*  
3. System responds with synthesized speech + shows live transcripts  
4. Continue conversation via **voice or text**  
5. Ask for charts (e.g., *“Show me revenue trends”*)  

**Tech Highlights:**  
- Multi-agent orchestration (ASR → LLM reasoning → RAG → TTS)  
- Real-time voice + text interface  
- Analytics retrieval + visualization in one loop

##  Highlight Project: Voice AI + Analytics Agent  
This project best demonstrates my **AI-native development ability**:  
- Orchestrates multiple agents in real time  
- Combines **speech, text, retrieval, analytics, and visualization**  
- Feedback loop with transcripts and continuous improvement

##  My AI-Native Development Workflow  
I typically build projects with **Claude Code + my own structured process**:  

1. Provide **full repo context** (frontend + backend) for the LLM  
2. Define features clearly, confirm understanding, answer clarifying questions  
3. Ask for **efficient architectures** → finalize design  
4. Generate a `tasks.md` file with step-by-step breakdown  
5. Implement task-by-task → test → refine  
6. Always manually review LLM output (never let AI handle DB ops directly)  
7. Continuous feedback + iteration until completion

## Closing Note  
These demos represent how I approach building **AI-native GTM platforms and assistants**:  
- Practical architectures  
- Fast iterations  
- Focus on real adoption and usability  

Feel free to try them out using the credentials provided above.
